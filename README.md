# Linked machine learning classifiers improve species classification of fungi when using error-prone long-reads on extended metabarcodes
___

A proof-of-concept for the use of linked machine learning classifiers for the purpose of detecting key target species from basecalled Oxford Nanopore reads.

We include the code used for the DNA filtering, the training and testing of machine learning models, and the linking of models into a decision tree.

While the specific code is not optimised for end-user use, we demonstrated that the tree-descent approach using linked machine learning models is viable (see [our paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.01.442223v2))

### Creating a Linked Machine Learning Decision Tree
As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate the applicability of a linked machine learning decision tree. Here, we lay out the steps necessary to generate your own decision tree for use for fungal species detection. <br>

1. Obtain DNA sequence for the same region for a number of different species across the fungal kingdom, including the target species and several close relatives from the same family and genus, and filter for higher quality reads to improve the accuracy of training. Ensure you have the full taxonomic information for each species used<sup>1</sup> 
2. Using a cladogram, identify the nodes where two or more taxa diverge, and note all samples that belong to each branch of the node. For each node, randomly subsample an equal number of reads from all species belonging to each branch, such that the number of subsampled reads for each branch at a node is equal, and representative of the samples belonging to that node 
3. Convert the DNA sequence for reads at a node to integer or one-hot encoding and pad each sequence using a null value to ensure all lengths are equivalent 
4. Randomly subsample 85% of the encoded data for use in training the models, and the other 15% for testing the models. Define the labels for each read so that each read has a label identifying the taxa it belongs to (eg. Ascomycota or Basidiomycota when training a model to distinguish between phyla) 
5. Create the machine learning model using the Sequential model. As a convolutional neural network applied to one-dimensional (linear) data, this will require multiple one-dimensional convolution layers. See the machine_learning_script for the specific parameters used here. Compile the model and fit the model using several epochs ($\geq$10), using the test dataset set aside in step 4 as the validation dataset 
6. Repeat steps 3-5 for each node in the decision tree to create a machine learning classifier for every node 
7. Link the resultant models together such that a read is passed along the paths in the decision tree based on the output of the machine learning classifiers. For example, if the output of the model that distinguishes between fungal phyla outputs that a read belongs to the Ascomycota phylum, the read is input to the next node along that path (likely the model that distinguishes between classes within the Ascomycota phylum). See below <br>

Note that not all steps along the path are nodes, which can be remedied by increasing the diversity of taxa chosen for training.
